# Covid-19 Vaccine Notification Bots
This repository contains some of the Python scripts I wrote to tweet out available vaccine appointments. The accounts used to tweet were [@LongIslandVax](twitter.com/longislandvax), [@azvaccinebot](twitter.com/azvaccinebot), and [@ConnecticutVax](twitter.com/connecticutvax).
