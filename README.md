# Covid-19 Vaccine Notification Bots
This repository contains some of the Python scripts I wrote in March, 2020 to tweet out available COVID-19 vaccine appointments. The accounts used to tweet were [@LongIslandVax](https://twitter.com/longislandvax), [@azvaccinebot](https://twitter.com/azvaccinebot), and [@ConnecticutVax](https://twitter.com/connecticutvax).
